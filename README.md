Answers to the Following questions..

1.
Use getElementById (when you just want one specific thing by its ID)

Use getElementsByClassName (when you want a bunch of elements that share a class)

Use querySelector (when you want one element using any CSS selector)

Use querySelectorAll (when you want all matching elements with full CSS selector flexibility)


2.
You use document.createElement() to create a brand-new element.

3.
Event bubbling is the process where an event starts from the element that was actually clicked (or interacted with) and then moves upward through its parent elements.

4.
Event delegation is a JavaScript technique where you add an event listener to a parent element to handle events for its child elements.

5.
preventDefault() stops the default browser behavior like stopping a link from opening a new page. On the other hand, stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
